# yam_setup.sh

## Before running this script

### Setup domain and DNS

You will need to have a domain name pointed to your servers IP address and configured like the following example:

Type | Hostname | Value | TTL
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
CNAME | `*.dev.mymodxhosting.com` | is an alias of `dev.mymodxhosting.com` | 43200
A | `dev.mymodxhosting.com` | directs to `<your_server_ip>` | 600

### Edit variables in yam_setup.sh

#### YAM_EMAIL_BUG

This email address is printed in the header of files generated by the yam-server-configurator. Example message:
```
# Generated by the YAM server configurator
# Do not edit as you may loose your changes
# If you have found a bug, please email ${YAM_EMAIL_BUG}
```

#### YAM_EMAIL_SSL

This email address is used by LetsEncrypt to send you renewal reminders.

#### YAM_DATEFORMAT_TIMEZONE

Use a [PHP based timezone](http://php.net/manual/en/timezones.php). This will set your servers timezone. It will also set the timezone for your default website.

#### YAM_SERVER_NAME

This should be the name of the server you created through the Digital Ocean control panel. It is used to organise backups on Amazon S3 in the following format:

```
/servers/backups/${YAM_SERVER_NAME}/
```
This format allows for multiple servers to be backed up on to 1 Amazon S3 bucket.

### Remember to setup Amazon S3 after installation

Type the following into the command line to configure the Amazon s3cmd plugin. This is required to enable backups to work correctly.
```
s3cmd --configure
```

### yam_setup.sh
